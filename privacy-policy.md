## How We Use Your Data

### Core Functionality
- **Budgeting Features:** All budget and financial data is stored locally on your device
- **Crash Reporting:** To identify and fix technical issues
- **Analytics:** To improve app functionality by understanding usage patterns

## Advertising

Budgetum includes advertising through Google AdMob in its free version. Users can remove ads through a one-time in-app purchase. The advertising experience includes:
- Non-personalized banner advertisements
- No personalized ad targeting
- Ads are shown based on general factors like device type and region, not personal data

We've chosen to use only non-personalized ads to better protect user privacy. This means:
- We don't use device advertising identifiers for ad targeting
- No personal data is shared with advertisers
- Ads are context-based rather than behavior-based

## User Rights and Choices

As a Budgetum user, you have several rights and choices:

- **Export Data:** Create local backup files of your data
- **Delete Data:** Uninstall the app to remove all local data
- **Ad Preferences:** Control personalized advertising through device settings
- **Remove Ads:** Purchase the ad-free version of the app

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Significant changes will be communicated through the app, and continued use indicates acceptance of updated terms.
