## Introduction

Welcome to Budgetum. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a transparent user experience. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data within the Budgetum app, a free personal budgeting tool that stores all user data locally on your device. **Budgetum does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers.**

## Information We Collect

### Data You Provide
- **Budget and Financial Information:** Information you enter, such as income, expenses, and budgeting categories, is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to or collect any of this data.

### Automatically Collected Data
To provide a free experience, Budgetum displays ads through Google AdMob. These ads are non-personalized and do not use your personal data for ad targeting.

- **Advertising ID:** Google AdMob collects an advertising identifier to serve non-personalized ads only. These ads are based on general, non-specific information rather than personalized data.
